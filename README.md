###Executive Summary:

Music industry has gone through a significant transformation in the last 20 years and it’s continuing involving. One of the major players of this revolution is Spotify. In merely 10 years, Spotify became the No. 1 music streaming service and main revenue source for many artists and music vendors from large music powerhouses to independent labels. While its positive effect on the music industry as whole is still up for a debate, we would like to study its data to find some insights on this new phenomenon. Luckily, Spotify provided us a feature rich RESTful API to play with. We would like to use the next two weeks to explore and analyze the data and provide the following possible interactive visualizations and analysis:
##### 1. General Trend of Music Industry
* Provide a historical view of the transformation of music industry by revenue source (brick and mortar to online streaming), by medium, and by consumer populations
* A historical view of Spotify’s raise vs. other streaming services
* Provide a dynamic visualization dashboard to illustrate the market condition
 
##### 2. Spotify API
* A quick review of how the API is set up, how to connect to it using Python, and what kind of data set are available
* Spotify Data exploration (visualization) - by using top 200 chart site, we can provide:
    i.      Music Patterns over time
    ii.      Music Patterns over geographic area (map)
##### 3. Final Bar Chart Race visualization
* Using Python Flourish to build a cool bar chart race showing time series-based visualization:
    i.  Best artist/genre over 2 years by week
    ii. Music streaming providers by volume, revenue, subscribers, over time
 
#### Tools used:
* Python libraries (bar chart race)
* JavaScript libraries (map, chart, etc)
* Tableau – final presentation in story mode
* Spotify API with Spotipy (and listening to a lot of music)
